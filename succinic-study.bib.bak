  abstract = {We present the first nonadditive molecular dynamics simulation of
	organic liquids, studying the structure and energetics of methanol
	and N-methylacetamide. Beginning with an additive potential that
	reproduces the structure and energetics of these liquids quite well,
	we have shown that one can simply reduce the atomic charges by a
	scale factor in the range of 0.88-0.90 and add isotropic atomic polarizabilities
	to create nonadditive models that also quite accurately reproduce
	the structures and energies of these liquids. Thus, we have a clear
	pathway for the general inclusion of nonadditive effects for organic
	and biological molecules.},

	of water is evaluated using classical molecular dynamics techniques
	with a polarizable potential model {[}Dang, L. X.; Chang, T.-M. J.
	Chem. Phys. 1997, 106, 8149]. The computed water monomer dipole moment
	in water clusters is significantly enhanced because of induction
	effects created by other water molecules. In particular, the magnitude
	of polarization effects reported recently by high-level ab initio
	calculations {[}Gregory, J. K.; Clary, D. C.; Liu, K.: Brown, M.
	G.; Saykally, R. J. Science 1997, 275, 814] is well-reproduced in
	our simulations. The structure of liquid water at ambient and supercritical
	conditions is investigated. The evolution of the hydrogen-bonding
	peak in g(OH) is in good agreement with recent data obtained by neutron
	diffraction with isotopic substitution experiments (NDIS) {[}Postorino,
	P.; Tromp, RH.; Ricci, M. A.; Soper, A. K.; Neilson, G. W. Nature
	1993, 366, 668]. This behavior can be attributed to the variability
	of water dipole moments in different environments, At conditions
	near critical temperature, in contrast with the interpretation of
	the NDIS data, the data from our simulations indicated that a considerable
	degree of hydrogen bonding remains at this state. This result is
	in good agreement with very recent proton NMR chemical shift measurements.},

  abstract = {Deriving atomic charges and building a force field library for a new
	molecule are key steps when developing a force field required for
	conducting structural and energy-based analysis using molecular mechanics.
	Derivation of popular RESP charges for a set of residues is a complex
	and error prone procedure because it depends on numerous input parameters.
	To overcome these problems, the R. E. D. Tools (RESP and ESP charge
	Derive, http://q4md-forcefieldtools.org/RED/) have been developed
	to perform charge derivation in an automatic and straightforward
	way. The R.E.D. program handles chemical elements up to bromine in
	the periodic table. It interfaces different quantum mechanical programs
	employed for geometry optimization and computing molecular electrostatic
	potential(s), and performs charge fitting using the RESP program.
	By de. ning tight optimization criteria and by controlling the molecular
	orientation of each optimized geometry, charge values are reproduced
	at any computer platform with an accuracy of 0.0001 e. The charges
	can be fitted using multiple conformations, making them suitable
	for molecular dynamics simulations. R.E.D. allows also for de. ning
	charge constraints during multiple molecule charge fitting, which
	are used to derive charges for molecular fragments. Finally, R.E.D.
	incorporates charges into a force field library, readily usable in
	molecular dynamics computer packages. For complex cases, such as
	a set of homologous molecules belonging to a common family, an entire
	force field topology database is generated. Currently, the atomic
	charges and force field libraries have been developed for more than
	fifty model systems and stored in the RESP ESP charge DDataBase.
	Selected results related to non-polarizable charge models are presented
	and discussed.},

	in place of Lagrange interpolation leads to analytic gradients as
	well as a significant improvement in the accuracy. We demonstrate
	that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size
	N, at a cost that scales as N log(N). For biomolecular systems with

  abstract = {Molecular Dynamics is a powerful methodology for the comprehension
	at molecular level of many chemical and biochemical systems. The
	theories and techniques developed for structural and thermodynamic
	analyses are well established, and many software packages are available.
	However, designing starting configurations for dynamics can be cumbersome.
	Easily generated regular lattices can be used when simple liquids
	or mixtures are studied. However, for complex mixtures, polymer solutions
	or solid adsorbed liquids (for example) this approach is inefficient,
	and it turns out to be very hard to obtain an adequate coordinate
	file. In this article, the problem of obtaining an adequate initial
	configuration is treated as a "packing" problem and solved by an
	optimization procedure. The initial configuration is chosen in such
	a way that the minimum distance between atoms of different molecules
	is greater than a fixed tolerance. The optimization uses a well-known
	algorithm for box-constrained minimization. Applications are given
	for biomolecule solvation, many-component mixtures, and interfaces.
	This approach can reduce the work of designing starting configurations
	from days or weeks to few minutes or hours, in an automated fashion.
	Packing optimization is also shown to be a powerful methodology for
	space search in docking of small ligands to proteins. This is demonstrated
	by docking of the thyroid hormone to its nuclear receptor. (C) 2003

	consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such
	a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure.
	In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der
	Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules Must
	keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining Such a molecular arrangement
	can be considered it packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy
	spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the
	distance between atoms of different molecules Must be greater than
	some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions
	of atoms. grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety
	of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of
	spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide
	only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical
	constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex
	mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents,

  abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules.
	GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields
	for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic
	and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S,
	P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number
	of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models
	to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance
	of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic
	structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square
	displacement of 0.26 Angstrom, which is comparable to that of the
	Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Angstrom) and better than those of MMFF
	94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Angstrom, respectively). In test II,
	gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs,
	and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared
	to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies
	were 0.25 A and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable
	to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Angstrom and 1.18 kcal/mol. respectively),
	which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at
	the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in
	development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative
	energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can
	be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion. making
	it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. (C)

	 The free energy differences between the cation and the anions arise
	from the interaction of the ions with the water molecules in the
	interfacial region.  These water molecules are oriented with a slight
	preference for their molecular dipoles to point toward the liquid.
	 Thus, the anion approaching the interface disrupt the water structures
	less than does the cation.  The calculated free energy curves are
	compared with predictions of simple dielectric models.  It is shown
	that these models do not provide a good description of ions at the
	water surface.  The ions are found to retain their solvation shells
	at the interface.  The anions also retain part of their second solvation
	shells, while Na+ does not.  As a result, a larger bulge in the water
